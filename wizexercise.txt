Ode to the Guarded Bits

In a land of clouds so high and vast,
A tale unfolds from the digital past.
Servers humming in the air so cool,
A techie works, with tools as his jewel.

He built a fortress, strong and proud,
With walls of code, he shouted loud:
“Behold my creation, so sleek and fine,
An app so secure, it practically shines!”

But oh, the folly of mortal mind,
For in his code, a flaw he'd find.
A backdoor left, not quite by plan,
For even the best miss now and then.

The techie laughed and scratched his head,
“I guess that’s life,” he wisely said.
“No fortress tall or wall so thick,
Can stop a bug, a glitch, a trick.”

So in his wisdom, a note he’d pen,
Inside "wizexercise.txt", for women and men:
"Here lies a lesson, don't you see,
In security, there's no guarantee."

“Let this file, so simple and small,
Remind us to question, doubt, and appall.
For in our quest to secure our creation,
Humor and humility make a strong foundation.”

And so the tale ends, not with a bang,
But a chuckle, a smile, and a little harangue.
In cybersecurity, as in life so vast,
It’s the journey that matters, not just the task.
